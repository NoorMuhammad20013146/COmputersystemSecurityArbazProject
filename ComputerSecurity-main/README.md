## Computer_Systems_Security
### Overview
This repository contains a chat web application specifically designed for security testing. The main objective is to identify and address security vulnerabilities within the application.

### Application Proposal

-Payload Encryption: Ensure messages are properly encrypted using AES algorithm.

-Key Transfer: Use of Diffie Hellman algorithm to transfer other users private key between client and server.

-User Authorization: Role-based access control and permissions.

-Rate limiting: Protect against brute-force attacks by integrating 2FA.

-Security headers: use of JWT tokens.
